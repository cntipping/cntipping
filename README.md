Hello!

I'm Cecilia, a student at Southern Methodist University studying computer science, physics, and data science.

For work, I currently do research where I am creating an emulator for one class of galaxy simulations in order to predict observable quatities such as the luminosity of different emission lines from physical quantities like star formation rates or galaxy diameter.

I tend to gravitate towards projects that allow me to problem solve while creating high-impact solutions. 

Outside of work and my studies, I'm interested in formula1, legos, and all things tech related.
